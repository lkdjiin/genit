<h2 id="what">What is Genit ?</h2>

<p>
Genit aims to build <strong>static web sites</strong>.
By static, I mean a web site without server side programing language or database management system.
A site for Genit consists only of xhtml code (+ css and medias) and eventually of javascript code.

<p>
The Genit project started in June 2011, I work on it only in my
spare time. So don't expect a major release every week !
