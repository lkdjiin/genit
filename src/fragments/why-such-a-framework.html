<h2 id="why">why such a framework ?</h2>
<p>
Some websites, like GitHub, provide free hosting space, but only for static web 
pages, no DBMS, no PHP, no Ruby, nothing more than HTML.

There are many good solutions around to build static web sites but none of them suits my needs perfectly.
As developing this type of application with Ruby is a real pleasure, I started the Genit project...
