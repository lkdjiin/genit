  <h2>First install Ruby and rubygem</h2>
  <p>
    As Genit is written in Ruby 1.9.2, you need at least the Ruby 1.9.2 interpreter to run it. You need rubygem too.
    Rubygem is a marvelous Ruby application that acts as an installer.<br/>
    Go to <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org">www.ruby-lang.org</a> and follow the instructions...<br/>
    If you run into troubles when installing Ruby 1.9.2, you can see the
    <a href="documentation/book-of-genit-en.html">book of Genit</a>. The first chapter is about
    installing Ruby.

  <h2>Smoke test</h2>
  <p>
    This step is optional but performing the smoke test is a good thing to be sure
    the installation is well done.<br/>
    Open a console window and type:
  </p>
  <pre><code>
  genit create test
  cd test
  genit compile
  genit server
  </code></pre>
  <p>
    Then point your browser to localhost:3000.<br/>
    That's it !
